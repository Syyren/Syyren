                    Oh, whoa is me!
                    <br> It feels as though the B.O.B.A. is appearing more and more frequently.
                    <br> I was minding my business, attending an online lecture for school when this,
                    <br> this,
                    <br> foul creature lept on my desk with a yelp!
                    <br> Startled half to death it took all I had just to snap this one image.
                    <br> How much longer must I endure?
                </p>
                <h2 id="B2">March 26, 2023 - Not a Dream</h2>
                <p>
                    Again.  It called out again.
                    <br> I don't know how much more I can take.
                    <br> It's been one day, but it feels like this creature, this B.O.B.A, has been around for ages.
                    <br> I'm going to sleep with one eye open tonight.
                    <br> This morning I found it in my hallway, a small screech emitted from its throat before it ran off.
                    <br> May god have mercy on my soul.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's here.
                    <br> I can hear it in the walls.  Scurying around, wherever it may be.
                    <br> Am I going insane?  Am I cursed?  
                    <br> I don't know what the creature is, but I've gotten a vague picture.
                    <br> Its coat is as black as the void of space.
                    <br> Spots appear throughout its coat of pure blinding white light.
                    <br> Emerald eyes leak out from its twisted face.
                    <br> The creature has three fangs, of this I'm sure.
                    <br> I've elected to call this creature:
                    <br> The Brainless, Obtrusive and Beautiful Aberration
                    <br> Or B.O.B.A. for short.
